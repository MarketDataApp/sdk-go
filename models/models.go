// Package models defines the data structures used to represent the responses from the Market Data API.
// It includes models for stock quotes, options quotes, stock candles, market status, and more.
// Each model is designed to parse and validate the JSON responses from the API, providing a structured
// way to interact with market data. The package also includes methods for unpacking these responses
// into more usable Go data types, such as converting timestamps to time.Time objects.
