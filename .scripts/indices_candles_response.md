## type IndicesCandlesResponse

IndicesCandlesResponse represents the response structure for indices candles data. It includes slices for time, open, high, low, and close values of the indices.

### Generated By

- `IndexCandlesRequest.Packed()`

  This method sends the IndicesCandlesRequest to the Market Data API and returns the IndicesCandlesResponse. It handles the actual communication with the \[/v1/indices/candles/] endpoint, sending the request, and returns a packed response that strictly conforms to the Market Data JSON response without unpacking the result into individual candle structs.


### Methods

- `String()`

  Provides a formatted string representation of the IndicesCandlesResponse instance. This method is primarily used for logging or debugging purposes, allowing the user to easily view the contents of an IndicesCandlesResponse object in a human\-readable format. It concatenates the time, open, high, low, and close values of the indices into a single string.

- `Unpack() ([]Candle, error)`

  Unpacks the IndicesCandlesResponse into a slice of Candle structs, checking for errors in data consistency.

- `MarshalJSON()`

  Marshals the IndicesCandlesResponse into a JSON object with ordered keys.

- `UnmarshalJSON(data []byte)`

  Custom unmarshals a JSON object into the IndicesCandlesResponse, including validation.

- `Validate()`

  Runs checks for time in ascending order, equal slice lengths, and no empty slices.

- `IsValid()`

  Checks if the IndicesCandlesResponse passes all validation checks and returns a boolean.


```go
type IndicesCandlesResponse struct {
    Date  []int64   `json:"t"` // Date holds the Unix timestamps for each candle, representing the time at which each candle was opened.
    Open  []float64 `json:"o"` // Open contains the opening prices for each candle in the response.
    High  []float64 `json:"h"` // High includes the highest prices reached during the time period each candle represents.
    Low   []float64 `json:"l"` // Low encompasses the lowest prices during the candle's time period.
    Close []float64 `json:"c"` // Close contains the closing prices for each candle, marking the final price at the end of each candle's time period.
}
```

<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.IsValid"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) IsValid

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) IsValid() bool
```

#### Returns

- `bool`

  Indicates whether the IndicesCandlesResponse is valid.


<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.MarshalJSON"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) MarshalJSON

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
```

MarshalJSON marshals the IndicesCandlesResponse struct into a JSON object, ensuring the keys are ordered as specified. This method is particularly useful when a consistent JSON structure with ordered keys is required for external interfaces or storage. The "s" key is set to "ok" to indicate successful marshaling, followed by the indices data keys "t", "o", "h", "l", and "c".

#### Returns

- `[]byte`

  A byte slice representing the marshaled JSON object. The keys within the JSON object are ordered as "s", "t", "o", "h", "l", and "c".

- `error`

  An error object if marshaling fails, otherwise nil.


<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.String"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) String

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) String() string
```

String provides a formatted string representation of the IndicesCandlesResponse instance. This method is primarily used for logging or debugging purposes, allowing the user to easily view the contents of an IndicesCandlesResponse object in a human\-readable format. It concatenates the time, open, high, low, and close values of the indices into a single string.

#### Returns

- `string`

  A formatted string containing the time, open, high, low, and close values of the indices.


<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.UnmarshalJSON"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) UnmarshalJSON

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error
```

UnmarshalJSON custom unmarshals a JSON object into the IndicesCandlesResponse, incorporating validation to ensure the data integrity of the unmarshaled object. This method is essential for converting JSON data into a structured IndicesCandlesResponse object while ensuring that the data adheres to expected formats and constraints.

#### Parameters

- `[]byte`

  A byte slice of the JSON object to be unmarshaled.


#### Returns

- `error`

  An error if unmarshaling or validation fails, otherwise nil.


<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.Unpack"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) Unpack

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) Unpack() ([]Candle, error)
```

Unpack converts the IndicesCandlesResponse into a slice of IndexCandle.

Returns:

- A slice of IndexCandle, error if there's an inconsistency in the data slices.

<a name="IndicesCandlesResponse.Validate"></a>
### func \(\*IndicesCandlesResponse\) Validate

```go
func (icr *IndicesCandlesResponse) Validate() error
```

Validate performs multiple checks on the IndicesCandlesResponse to ensure data integrity. This method is crucial for verifying that the response data is consistent and reliable, specifically checking for time sequence, equal length of data slices, and the presence of data in each slice. It's used to preemptively catch and handle data\-related errors before they can affect downstream processes.

#### Returns

- `error`

  An error if any validation check fails, otherwise nil. This allows for easy identification of data integrity issues.
